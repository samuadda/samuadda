# 👋 Hey, I'm Saddiq  
**Frontend Developer • SaaS Builder**

I build products end-to-end —  
from UI → backend → automation → onboarding → final ship.

I focus on clean interfaces, smooth animations, and products that actually solve real problems.

- **Bilfora** — Invoicing SaaS (Next.js + Supabase + PDF Engine)
- **Sirancy** — AI Automation Agency Landing (motion-heavy, bilingual)
- **Workflow Visualizer** — Concept tool for mapping automation flows
- **Micro AI Tools** — Sahih, Nahj, and more
